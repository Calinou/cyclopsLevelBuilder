# Prism Tool

The prism tool lets you place multiple points for your base before dragging out the length of your block.

* Click in empty space or on the surface of a block to begin placing points for the base of your block.
     * Keep clicking to place more points for the base
     * To remove the last point you added, press the Backspace key
     * To cancel building the block, press the Escape key
     * When you're finished building your base, press Enter to switch to dragging the height of the block.
